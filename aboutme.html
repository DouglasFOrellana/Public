    <p>Hello! <br>
        My name is Douglas Orellana, I'm a born and proud instate student. <br>I grew up only 40 minutes from here in Providence. <br> I'm also sophmore at the university of Rhode Island and also  a commited computer science major & trying to minor in business. 
       <br> Over the summer I did tons of things that I would love to share with you! </p>

<p>On the weekends I played in a co-ed futsal tournament which was taken place in Central Falls, RI. <br> In this image you can see me in game  standing with the ball at my feet and I'm carfully watching my opponents movments.
